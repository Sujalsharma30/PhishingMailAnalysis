🎣 IRCTC Refund Phishing Analysis

Welcome to my short case study on a phishing email investigation. In this task, I analyzed a suspicious email pretending to be from IRCTC Helpdesk and uncovered several classic phishing indicators.

🕵️ What I Did

Collected a sample phishing email claiming a ₹4,240 refund from IRCTC.

Checked the sender’s address — found it came from irctc-helpdesk@securesupportcloud.com, not the official irctc.co.in domain.

Used an online header analyzer to confirm mismatched sender details.

Identified phishing traits in the email body:

False refund offer (the bait 💰)

Urgent tone (“Link expires in 2 days”)

Suspicious QR code asking users to claim money

Documented all red flags and summarized them for awareness.

🚩 Key Indicators Found

Fake domain impersonating IRCTC

Emotional manipulation using greed and urgency

Unverifiable QR code leading to potential credential theft

Unprofessional grammar and inconsistent formatting

🧠 Takeaway

This exercise shows how easily scammers exploit trust and urgency.
Always double-check sender domains, avoid scanning QR codes from unknown sources, and verify directly through official websites instead of clicking links in emails.

Stay sharp — every “refund” might just be the hook of a phishing scam. 🎯
